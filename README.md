##Introduction
Object detection and tracking is a challenging problem in the field of Computer
Vision which has many practical applications such as video surveillance, face
recognition, gesture recognition, robot navigation, augmented reality, etc.
Detection of an object is a challenging task because of the large variations in
parameters like object size along with its positions, changes in background i.e.
dynamic background, illumination effect i.e. lighting conditions along with other
contributing factors. The quality of detection algorithms are improving yet there 
is a struggle to detect occluded objects
